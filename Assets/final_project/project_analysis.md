# Kix Beverages Data Analysis Problem Statement

**Objective**

Kix Beverages aims to improve strategic and operational decision-making by analyzing customer behavior, product performance, store revenue, and temporal financial trends. The goal is to develop three interactive dashboards that deliver actionable insights to optimize marketing, inventory, staffing, and financial planning.

# Problem Description

Kix Beverages faces challenges in understanding which customer segments drive the most profit, identifying seasonal and daily profitability patterns, determining top-performing products, assessing store performance against revenue targets, and tracking revenue trends over time. Without clear, data-driven insights, the company struggles to make informed decisions on marketing strategies, inventory management, staffing allocation, and financial planning.

# Proposed Solution

To address these challenges, three dashboards will be developed, leveraging tools like Power Query for data preparation and transformation:

**Dashboard 1: Customer & Product Profitability**

Customer Analysis: Analyze profit generated by male and female customers and average spending by age group to identify high-value customer segments.

Profitability over Time: Track profit trends and month-over-month growth to uncover seasonal patterns and assess sales effectiveness.

Profitability by Weekday: Identify the most profitable weekdays to optimize staffing and marketing efforts.


Product Analysis: Highlight top-selling and most profitable products, alongside return and refund rates, to inform inventory management and product strategy.

**Dashboard 2: Store Performance & Revenue Tracking**


Store Budget vs. Revenue: Compare actual revenue against targets for each store to identify underperforming or outperforming locations.

Month-by-Month Analysis: Provide a detailed breakdown of monthly revenue and targets to detect variances and support financial planning.

**Dashboard 3: Time-Based Revenue Performance**

Quarterly Revenue Analysis: Compare quarterly revenue against the average to evaluate performance trends.

Weekday vs. Weekend Revenue: Analyze revenue differences between weekdays and weekends to guide staffing and operational decisions.

Monthly Revenue vs. Target: Track monthly revenue against goals to enable agile financial adjustments.

**Expected Outcomes**

These dashboards will empower Kix Beverages to make data-backed decisions, enhancing customer targeting, product offerings, store operations, and financial strategies, ultimately driving profitability and operational efficiency.
