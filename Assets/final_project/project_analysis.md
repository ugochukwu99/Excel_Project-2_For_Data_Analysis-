# Kix Beverages Data Analysis Problem Statement

**Objective**

Kix Beverages aims to improve strategic and operational decision-making by analyzing customer behavior, product performance, store revenue, and temporal financial trends. The goal is to develop three interactive dashboards that deliver actionable insights to optimize marketing, inventory, staffing, and financial planning.

# Problem Description

Kix Beverages faces challenges in understanding which customer segments drive the most profit, identifying seasonal and daily profitability patterns, determining top-performing products, assessing store performance against revenue targets, and tracking revenue trends over time. Without clear, data-driven insights, the company struggles to make informed decisions on marketing strategies, inventory management, staffing allocation, and financial planning.

# Proposed Solution

To address these challenges, three dashboards will be developed, leveraging tools like Power Query for data preparation and transformation:

**Dashboard 1: Customer & Product Profitability**

**ðŸ‘¥ Customer Analysis:** _Analyze profit generated by male and female customers and average spending by age group to identify high-value customer segments._

The profit distribution by gender reveals a fairly balanced contribution between male and female customers, with male customers generating 51.47% of the total profit and female customers contributing 48.53%. While the difference is marginal, the slight edge indicates potential to tailor engagement strategies by gender to further optimize conversions.

When analyzing profit by customer age group, a clear trend emerges: older age groups generate significantly more profit. Customers aged 51 and above contribute the highest profit at $933K, followed by the 41â€“50 age group at $496K. In contrast, younger demographics (ages 0â€“20) only account for $65K.

**ðŸ“ˆProfitability over Month Periods:** _Track profit trends and month-over-month growth to uncover seasonal patterns and assess sales effectiveness._

The month-over-month profitability analysis shows a volatile pattern throughout the year. January starts flat at 0.0%, followed by a strong +15.1% spike in February, likely due to seasonal promotions. March sees a -5.6% drop, indicating campaign fatigue or reduced demand. April rebounds slightly at +6.6%, but May (-4.9%) and June (-6.5%) decline, suggesting a mid-year slowdown. July surges to +14.2%, driven by summer campaigns, but August plummets by -8.9%, the year's largest drop. September (+0.2%) and October (+1.0%) stabilize modestly, yet November unexpectedly falls by -6.7% despite the holiday season. Early December data suggests continued weakness. The business shows strong potential in peak months (February, July) but struggles with inconsistent growth due to sharp downturns. To improve, it should focus on consistent promotional strategies, replicate successful campaigns, investigate low-performing months (August, November), and align marketing with seasonal trends to reduce volatility.

**ðŸ“…Profitability by Weekday:** _Identify the most profitable weekdays to optimize staffing and marketing efforts._

The data on profit by weekday indicates that Monday ($343K) and Thursday ($341K) are the most profitable days, closely followed by Saturday ($332K). Conversely, Friday has the lowest profit ($320K), though the variance across weekdays is moderate.

**ðŸ“¦Product Analysis:** _Highlight top-selling and most profitable products, alongside return and refund rates, to inform inventory management and product strategy._



**Dashboard 2: Store Performance & Revenue Tracking**


Store Budget vs. Revenue: Compare actual revenue against targets for each store to identify underperforming or outperforming locations.

Month-by-Month Analysis: Provide a detailed breakdown of monthly revenue and targets to detect variances and support financial planning.

**Dashboard 3: Time-Based Revenue Performance**

Quarterly Revenue Analysis: Compare quarterly revenue against the average to evaluate performance trends.

Weekday vs. Weekend Revenue: Analyze revenue differences between weekdays and weekends to guide staffing and operational decisions.

Monthly Revenue vs. Target: Track monthly revenue against goals to enable agile financial adjustments.

**Expected Outcomes**

These dashboards will empower Kix Beverages to make data-backed decisions, enhancing customer targeting, product offerings, store operations, and financial strategies, ultimately driving profitability and operational efficiency.
