# ðŸ“ˆ KIX Beverages Business Analysis

## Project Overview

The Kix Beverages data analysis project provides three interactive dashboards to drive data-informed decisions across customer behavior, product performance, and financial metrics. **The Customer & Product Profitability Dashboard** examines customer demographics, spending patterns, and product performance, detailing profit by gender, average spending by age group, and profitability trends to identify high-value segments and seasonal effects, while daily profitability and return/refund rates guide staffing, promotions, and inventory strategies. **The Store Performance & Revenue Tracking Dashboard** compares actual store revenue against budgeted goals, highlighting underperforming or outperforming locations with monthly breakdowns to detect trends and inform financial planning. **The Time-Based Revenue Performance Dashboard** analyzes quarterly revenue, weekday versus weekend earnings, and monthly performance against targets to support operational and strategic adjustments. Together, these dashboards empower Kix Beverages to optimize marketing, operations, inventory, and financial planning with data-backed insights.

_This project uses data I obtained through the YouTube channel DataWithDecision365 to carry out a detailed business analysis for Kix Beverages._
